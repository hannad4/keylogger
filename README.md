# Python Keylogger

The following is a keylogger written in Python. 
It is primarily based off of [Ask Python's Creating a Python Keylogger in 10 Lines of Code](https://www.askpython.com/python/examples/python-keylogger) but has been modified with the following new capabilities: 


- User can specify a specific log file name
- User can specify a directory path where the log file should be saved
- <b>User MUST specify how long logging should occur
    - The default logging time is 60 seconds (1 min)
    - User should enter logging time using -t when running the program
